# Payment Calculator Development Summary

## What We Built

I've successfully created a comprehensive Next.js application that compares payment processor costs between Stripe and Merchant of Record solutions for UK businesses. The application includes:

### Key Features Implemented

1. **Interactive Cost Comparison Chart**
   - Line chart showing cost curves for both payment processors
   - Real-time updates as parameters change
   - Turnover range from £0 to £1M monthly
   - Built with Recharts and shadcn/ui chart components

2. **Configurable Parameters**
   - Transaction distribution by region (EU, US, UK, Other)
   - Subscription transaction percentage
   - Average subscription amount
   - Tax compliance toggles (EU VAT OSS, UK VAT, US Sales Tax)
   - Chargeback fee inclusion

3. **Modern UI/UX**
   - Built with shadcn/ui components
   - Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
   - Clean, professional interface
   - Interactive form controls (inputs, switches, cards)

4. **Comprehensive Cost Modeling**
   - Stripe UK rates (2024): 1.5% UK, 2.5% EU, 3.25% non-EU
   - Merchant of Record rates: 5% + $0.50 per transaction
   - Tax compliance costs for different jurisdictions
   - Currency conversion (USD to GBP)

```

#### Key Technologies
- **Next.js 15**: App Router, TypeScript, SSG
- **React 19**: Latest React features
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling
- **shadcn/ui**: Modern component library
- **Recharts**: Interactive charting
- **Radix UI**: Accessible primitives

#### Payment Calculator Logic
- `PaymentProcessorCalculator` class with methods:
  - `calculateStripeCosts()`: Comprehensive Stripe cost calculation
  - `calculateMoRCosts()`: Merchant of Record cost calculation
  - `generateChartData()`: Creates data points for visualization

### Build Status
✅ **Successfully Built**: The application compiles without errors  
✅ **TypeScript**: All type errors resolved  
✅ **ESLint**: All linting issues fixed  
✅ **Static Generation**: Pages pre-rendered at build time  

### How to Run

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Development Mode**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Production Build & Start**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm start
   ```

4. **Access the Application**
   - Open browser to `http://localhost:3000`
   - The app should load the payment calculator interface

### Key Insights from the Calculator

The application helps users understand:

1. **Cost Structure Differences**
   - Stripe: Percentage-based with fixed fees, plus tax compliance
   - MoR: Higher percentage but includes tax handling

2. **Break-even Analysis**
   - MoR better for small businesses with complex tax situations
   - Stripe becomes cost-effective at higher volumes

3. **Tax Compliance Impact**
   - EU VAT OSS: £200 setup + £180/month
   - UK VAT: Free setup + £120/month  
   - US Sales Tax: £250 setup + £220/month

4. **Regional Transaction Impact**
   - UK domestic transactions have lowest Stripe fees (1.5%)
   - EU transactions cost more (2.5%)
   - US/International highest (3.25%)

### Potential Enhancements

If continuing development, consider:
- Export functionality (PDF reports)
- Save/load configurations
- Multi-currency support
- Advanced tax scenarios
- Integration with actual payment processor APIs
- Historical rate tracking

### Summary

This is a fully functional, production-ready Next.js application that provides valuable business insights for UK companies choosing between payment processors. The code is well-structured, properly typed, and follows modern React/Next.js best practices.
